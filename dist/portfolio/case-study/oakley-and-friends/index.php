        <p><i>Oakley and friends is a professional dog walking company in macclesfield</i></p>
        <p>
          Oakley and friends is a local community business which solely focuses on providing dog walking services to macclesfield. The owner of the company required an online presence which showcased their gallery of previous dog walking events, in addition to providing potential future customers with a place to engage with the company.
        </p>
        <p>
          For this project, it was important that the audience was able to engage with the site, allowing them to see the gallery to see an engaging blog, while also being able to contact the company directly through the site. Allowing a fluid and flexible mobile design, the site is designed to be accessible to all audiences.
