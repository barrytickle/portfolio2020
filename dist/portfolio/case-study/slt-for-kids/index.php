        <h1>SLT for Kids</h1>
        <p><i>SLT for Kids are passionate and enthusiastic about helping each child achieve their best quality of life and are experienced in working with a range of difficulties.</i></p>
        <p>
          SLT for Kids was a site I had developed from start to finish while working at <a href="https://nuttersons.co.uk" target="_blank">Nuttersons</a>. The aim of this project was to provide an online presence for a newly rebranded service. Due to the older version of the site being a single landing page. The company itself wasn't receiving as many enquiries as it normally should with there not being much information to origionally go off.
        </p>
        <p>
          My role within this site was to develop the brand into a working product, considering conversion and accessibility. Users may use a text to speech software, which allows content to be read out on the site to the visitor. User's may also search the site using the Google search API, which allows them to find a page based on a content search.
