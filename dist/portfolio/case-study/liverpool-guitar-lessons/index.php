        <h1>Liverpool Guitar Lessons</h1>
        <p><i>Liverpool Guitar Lessons provides lessons by a very experienced guitar teacher who has taught pupils of all ages and taught a diverse range of musical styles.</i></p>
        <p>
           The aim of the project was to convert an existing theme into something which can provide a service for guitar enthusiasts. Nick origionally called to see what I can provide for this style of service.
         </p>
         <p>
           Following this, we had discussed previous projects I had completed which will fit into his current aims for his site. Which involved providing 3 designs which he may like, alongside a new logo to represent his new branded business.
         </p>
         <p>
           In addition to building a front-end site, I had also developed a wordpress back-end for Nick so that he may modify the content and different elements of his site whenever he needs. With inclusion of a contact form across all pages, which Nick can modify to get customer enquiries throughout his site.
         </p>
